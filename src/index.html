                            UK Landbank scams have been on the rise since the early 2000s, and have had sporadic media attention.<br>

                            <p>"Investors are usually called out of the blue, but contact can also come by email, post, word of mouth or at a seminar or exhibition.</p>
                            <p>Investors are told they will make big profits on small plots of land once planning permission is granted or development started.</p>
                            <p>But permission is often not granted or even applied for, and investors are left with land that is practically worthless."</p>

                            It is not clear if the schemes are illigal, in the same way that pyramid schemes are. But selling something known to be worthless, or without intent to render services promised, contravenes some finanacial and consumer legislation in many countries.

                            <p>"We have had many successes tackling land banking scams over several years, where unwary members of the public are sold almost worthless pieces of land with the promise of increased returns when planning permission is granted â€“ planning permission which will never be agreed due to the nature or location of the land."</p>

                                    <p>In 2006 Wayne Horwitz starts SJ Capital, likely with some help and ideas from others. The idea is to sell stakes in land that may, possibly, at a much later date be developed.</p>
                                    <p>Wayne also owns or manages an IT company called WebEasy out of Benoni in Gauteng. This allows him to easily create the online image of a reputable property investment company. </p>
                                    <p>SJ Capital is born, and Wayne begins to swindle unsuspecting people with the lure of investing in non-existant property in the UK.</p>

                                    <p>We could not find anything on LinkedIn, but Wayne has profiles on Crunchbase and Rocketreach.</p>
                                    <p>In 2009 the website "SJCapital.com" is registered, hosted by Wayne's WebEasy company.  </p>
                                    <p>To broaden the reach SJ Capital goes on a selling spree, setting up stands in bussiness districts and shopping malls in Sandton, Cape Town and likely Durban.</p>

                                <p>The strategy was simple: Politics were in shambles, loadshedding a reality, the Rand was falling and anxious people were looking for hope by trying to get international exposure.</p>
                                <p>Maybe UK Landscams were know in SA at the time, maybe not. But a team of salesmen and woman answered the call.</p>

									<p>According to his LinkedIn profile, Quinton has been with SJ Capital since 2007.

									<p>Quinton claim a Hons degree from the Universaty of Notthingham, and was likely instrumental in selecting the properties that were offered by SJ Capital. </p>
									<p>It is also likely that he was a connecting point for the redtape that would later act as layers of barriers between South Africans and the UK authoreties.</p>

								<p>As a land consultant, it would stand to reason that Rod was instrumental in selecting or atleast vetting the properties that were put up for "sale" by SJ Capital, and therefore by implication had knowlege that they were in flood zones, under water, or unsuitable for development.</p>
								<p>It would  be interesting to track down "Hereford Financial Services" and test their track record. If anyone out there has informaiton on them, please get in touch with us.</p>

                                both reported on the land investment sheme run by SJ capital in Aug 2021 and Aug 2025 respectively. The 2025 article became the most read news article for the news cycle, but yet, it seems nothing has come from it.
                                </p>
                            <p>The articles did highlight the issue of landscams in south africa, but also highlighted that the issue remains a matter for false representation, and would be hard to prosecute as criminal.

                            <p>After the first article in 2012, SJ Capital released a statement on their website, affectively calling it sensational and shifting the blame to the buyers "who did not read the fineprint". We found the origional statement here. <a href="https://www.sjcapitalgroup.com/response.html" target="_blank">SJ Capital Response</a>

                            <p>Almost no other coverage online was found. Some chatter in chatrooms such as hello peter or reddit would offer sporadic advice or serve as warnings or ventelation by the victims, but thusfar the purpotrators have gotten away scottfree, and investors are left with no returns, no refunds, and little options to recourse.

                                created a website to organise and communicate the broader issue of landscams to a wider audiance, pressure the UK govenrment to end these deceptive practices and ultimately recover their losses at some future point.
                                </p>
                            <p>This site was founded by a group of individuals who fell victim to this "scam," having invested over 2 million GBP in SJ Capital's scheme. It is estimate this represents less than 1% of the total invested in such schemes across the UK. The website, simmilar to this one, aims to maintain a record and bring the people and practices to light in the broader public eye.
